## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project



 

####Part 1: Optimize  index.html

1. Inline CSS code
1. Compress images and link with those
2. Run scripts asynchronously so they can not hold up any loads
3. Add print to media query  print.css
4. Updated JS with the code suggested by PageSpeed
5. Moved some JS to end of file to enable HTML do it's "GETs" first
6. Minify CSS and perfmatters.js

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.
